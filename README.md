# API

Used DDD
Hapi logging
Postman Folder
Launch instructions
Not best text search solution for title search 
Left off: authentication, linter, deploy in docker
ObjectId parsed to any sometimes. Gotta undersand better how this could work


# APP
Used bootstrap
UI could be have better user feedback such as loaders, locks, etc
Used fetch to get data. Have to study better, but angular http looked too much of a hassle with no big benefit
Lacked proper error handling when dealing with api

Instructions of how to run it

### Guidelines

1. Fork repository.

2. Create a note taking web application with the following requirements.

    2.1 Ability to list/create/read/update/delete notes.

    2.2 Notes have title and content.

    2.3 Content can be rich text.

    2.4 Ability to restrict listed notes by searching by title.

3. Issue a pull request.

Please split your commits into reasonably small chunks so progress can be seen.

__Important__: The solution must use Node.js and MongoDB in the back end and AngularJS 1.x and JavaScript or Angular 2 and TypeScript in the front end.
